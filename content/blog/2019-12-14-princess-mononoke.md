<!-- excerpt -->
*Princess Mononoke* is set in the late [Muromachi period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muromachi_period) (approximately 1336 to 1573) of Japan with fantasy elements. The story follows the young [Emishi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emishi) prince Ashitaka's involvement in a struggle between the gods of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The term "[Mononoke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononoke)" ([物の怪](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/物の怪)) or もののけ is not a name, but a Japanese word for a spirit or monster: supernatural, shape-shifting beings.

The film was released in Japan on July 12, 1997, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. It was a critical and commercial [blockbuster](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)), becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and also held Japan's box office record for domestic films until 2001's *[Spirited Away](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away)*, another Miyazaki film. It was [dubbed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)) into English and distributed in North America by [Miramax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax), and despite a poor box office performance there, it sold well on DVD and video, greatly increasing Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan.
