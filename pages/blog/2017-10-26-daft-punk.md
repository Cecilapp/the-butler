**Daft Punk** is a French [electronic music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music) duo formed in Paris in 1993 by [Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy-Manuel_de_Homem-Christo) and [Thomas Bangalter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bangalter). They achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the [French house](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_house) movement; they also had success in the years following, combining elements of [house music](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music) with [funk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk), [techno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno), [disco](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco), rock and [synthpop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthpop). They have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume [robot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot) personas in most public appearances since 1999 and rarely grant interviews or appear on television. The duo were managed from 1996 to 2008 by [Pedro Winter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Winter) (also known as Busy P), the head of [Ed Banger Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Banger_Records).

After Bangalter and Homem-Christo's [indie rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock) band [Darlin'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlin'_(French_band)) disbanded, they began experimenting with [drum machines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine) and synthesisers. Their debut studio album *[Homework](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homework_(Daft_Punk_album))* was released by [Virgin Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Records) in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by singles "[Around the World](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_(Daft_Punk_song))" and "[Da Funk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Funk)". Their second album, *[Discovery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(Daft_Punk_album)),* had further success, supported by hit singles "[One More Time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_More_Time_(Daft_Punk_song))", "[Digital Love](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Love_(Daft_Punk_song))" and "[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harder,_Better,_Faster,_Stronger)". In March 2005, Daft Punk released their third album, *[Human After All](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_After_All),* to mixed reviews, though the singles "[Robot Rock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Rock_(song))" and "[Technologic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technologic)" achieved success in the United Kingdom. Daft Punk [toured throughout 2006 and 2007](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alive_2006/2007) and released the live album *[Alive 2007](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alive_2007)*, which won a [Grammy Award](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award) for [Best Electronic/Dance Album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Electronic/Dance_Album). They composed the score for the film *[Tron: Legacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy)*, which was released in 2010 alongside [its soundtrack album](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy_(soundtrack)).

In 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for [Columbia Records](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records), and released their fourth album, *[Random Access Memories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Access_Memories),* to acclaim; lead single "[Get Lucky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Lucky_(Daft_Punk_song))" reached the top 10 in the charts of 32 countries. *Random Access Memories* won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including [Album of the Year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Album_of_the_Year) and [Record of the Year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Record_of_the_Year) for "Get Lucky". In 2016, Daft Punk gained their first number one on the [*Billboard* Hot 100](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100) with the song "[Starboy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starboy_(song))", a collaboration with [The Weeknd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd).
