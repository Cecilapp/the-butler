### Write your blog posts

Use [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) to manage your content: `https://your-blog.netlify.com/admin/`.

Or do it manually by putting your blog posts in the `content/blog/` directory.

### Customize your blog

Copy layouts files from [`themes/hyde/layouts/`](https://github.com/Cecilapp/theme-hyde/tree/master/layouts) to your own `layouts/` directory to _override_ them.
